# single linked-lists

linked lists - single, double, sorted, unsorted:

![complexity]('./time_complexity.png')

single linked lists are good for getting the minimum and maximum, and finding the next largest element (successor)

more pointers = log(n) search, but this is hard to maintain mutations (insertion and removal)

sorted lists have fast search - O(log(n))
