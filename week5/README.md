# Week 5

quiz 4

The approach that I took with the compress function was to find the first non-null odd element and set that to the pair head. I then iterated over the linked list of nodes and counted the number of nodes in order that have the same data. Then when new data is found, the pair is written to the pair linked list and a new pair is created. If you reach the end and the count is not equal to the number saved, update the last element.
